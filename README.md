At the first stage of the project a dataset for training ML models to predict robot pose was created from bag file in ROS.
Consequently NN and CNN models were created, trained and tested on the dataset.
Results of the project are fully described in the report located in 'report/'.
Developed neural network models could be found in the jupiter notebooks located in 'nn\_models/'
